Cello - [Peggy Lee](http://www.peggylee.net/). 

Stay for Cello and Live electronics is a composition that uses the score following software antescofo (Ircam) to create interaction between the Cellist and the Computer. The software makes it possible to follow the live tempo of the cellist, so the timing of the electronic sounds are based on the tempo that is played by the performer.
