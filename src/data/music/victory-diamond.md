*Victory Diamond* is inspired by the famous painting 'Victory Boogie Woogie' from Piet Mondriaan. Mondriaan worked on this painting until his death never finishing but always changing the placement of the colored squares. Victory Diamond is in this same way never finished, every performance the musicians have to play a different score but with the same building blocks.
