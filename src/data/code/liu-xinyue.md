For this project, I created the artist website of Xinyue Liu. The design was already made by my client, so I could start to focus on implementing the code, and making it flexible enough for her to add new art works on her own without my supervision using a CDN. This was my first project working with React and Gatsby.js as I wanted to use a tech stack that could offer free hosting of a static webpage, while still being able to update and create artworks with a CDN for free through NetlifyCMS.

In this project, besides the basics of React, I learned how to set up page templates and create pages programatically in Gatsby as well as learning more about creating plug-ins for Markup content in the CMS that enables specific content like video and styled images giving more flexibility to the client when adding new artworks to her site.
