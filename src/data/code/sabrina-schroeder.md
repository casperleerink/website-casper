The website for Sabrina Schroeder was the first projects I did for a client. Because I had no previous experience, I had to get accustomed to using data that can change over time using a Content Management System. For this project I used Keystone.js as it provided a free CMS that used node.js and express, with which I was already familiar.

In this project I collaborated with my client on the design, receiving the layout preferences and modifying those to my own capacity to get the desired results. This was a good exercise in CSS, to come up with ways to get the desired layout without having the option to change it to something I was familiar with.
