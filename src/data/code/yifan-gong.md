The portfolio website of Yifan Gong was the second website I created with Gatsby and NetlifyCMS. My client requested a fairly simple design in terms of navigation.

Most of the work went into creating dropdown lists that would work on both mobile and desktop views. In addition, my client requested a sidebar navigation for each item/work so users of the website are able to jump to different sections easily. I learned more about how to create a table of contents from a markdown file and incorporate that into react with the correct page navigation.
