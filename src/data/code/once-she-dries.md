Once She Dries is an online opera born out of the need to adapt a live opera after the COVID-19 pandemic hit. For this project I worked on creating an abstract image of the protagonist, a coral reef, I did this with the help of p5.js to draw the coral and make it move on screen and react to user interaction with the text of the story. As there are multiple acts in the story of the opera, I used various scenes in my code as well, changing the behavior of the coral based on the current act of the opera that is playing.
