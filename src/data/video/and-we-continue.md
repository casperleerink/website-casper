Enlightenment is when the wave recognizes it is the ocean

*- Thich Nhat Hanh*

*and we continue* is an interactive online performance that tells a story about the behavior of complex systems through the lens of water. Each participant starts out as an iconic representation of various forms of water, such as Ice or Cloud, and explores its individual existence. Later, real-time interactions between participants are explored along with influences of outside actors to the system, creating unpredictability. In the last stage, participants come together to form a system acting as a single entity.

The story is told through the use of music, video and text, all of which react to the participants’ actions. Each of these three media, together with all participant interactions, plays a part in the story of water and complexity by highlighting shifting time scales as humans influence earth’s water systems and underscoring the unpredictable consequences of individual actions within such systems.
