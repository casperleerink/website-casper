*The photos used in this project were given to the artist for free from a thrift store in Vancouver.*



*Conductivity* is the result of a collaboration between Xinyue Liu and me. We became interested in a series of photos Xinyue had obtained from a local thriftstore in Vancouver. On the back of the photographs, the precise time and place in which the photo was taken was written down. We revisited those places, sometimes 20 years later and intended to show the similarities and differences between now and then.

Each photograph was then placed inside a book lying on a table. Using conductivity and a microcontroller the book became interactive, where opening the book to a page with one of the photographs triggered the playback of a video taken in the same location as the photograph.

This work was shown at the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts as part of Changing Climates, the 2019 Canadian Anthropology Society and American Anthropological Association conference.

We were unable to get in touch with the photographer of these images, but if we were to cross paths in the future, please know that we are so thankful for your photographs, Mr. Logan.
